## Location
The LEMI-011 is currently located at the DORIS hut. The sensor is in the pillar outside the hut and the digital interface and logger are located inside the hut.

The pillar that the sensor is located in is sealed off on the sides with aluminium plates. The magnetometer has been aligned and should not be touched or removed.

When doing an inspection, it is of utmost importance to first remove power from the LEMI-011 sensor - do this by unplugging the power supply connected to the Digital Interface inside the hut.
