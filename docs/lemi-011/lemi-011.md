## Location
The LEMI-011 is currently located at the DORIS hut. The sensor is installed in a pillar next to the hut. The digital interface, power supply and logger are located inside the hut.

### Sensor
The pillar containing the sensor is covered on the sides by two aluminium plates. These plates are kept in place by four threaded rods with nuts on both sides. The sensor has been aligned, so it should not be touched or removed.

When doing an inspection or performing maintenance on the sensor it is of the utmost importance to first switch off the power to the LEMI-011 sensor. To do this, disconnect or unplug the power supply connected to the Digital Interface inside the DORIS Hut.

### Digital Interface
The [digital interface]() is located inside the DORIS Hut on the server rack. It gets powered by a power supply and is connected to the logger - a Raspberry Pi - via serial cable.

### Logger
The logger is a Raspberry Pi located somewhere on the server rack inside the DORIS Hut.
